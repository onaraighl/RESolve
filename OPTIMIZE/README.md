# RESolve

Suite of Matlab codes codes to solve the Richards Equation in 1D.

# Project overview:

* Theory and code analysis is documented in pdf document [notes1](https://github.com/onaraighl/RESolve/blob/main/notes1.pdf)
* Code allows for various boundary conditions including options for ponding at the top, free drainage at the bottom, and saturation at the bottom.
* Hydrus convention is adopted, whereby z=0 is the bottom and z=L is the top.  And by "top" I mean the surface, where the soil gets rained on!
* Sample code with (in Matlab) is provided in `SAMPLE/`
